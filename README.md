# Final-Project

**TRADO WEBSTOR PROJECT** 

The purpose of the store is to provide a unique platform in its solution anonymously.
The store caters to all users: retailers, sellers, shoppers, truckers.
A user can be any of the types of users.
And the store is the one that creates the relationship between all the users.
The details of the sellers and buyers are known to the system only and are not visible,
and this is what distinguishes this store from the rest of the things on the market.

The system provides management tools, decision-making, tracking and alerts when it relies on user behavior data,
contact with users purchasing and inventory systems,
contact with moving systems,
contact external systems for information to assess the capabilities of the buyer seeking financial assistance and more.
